 * nav.tsx = Navigation Bar
 *
 * @summary
 * The bar every TechGeek site fixes to the top of its pages: the hexagon mark
 * and the site's wordmark linking home, a link to each of the site's pages
 * with the current one marked, a call-to-action button, and on phones a
 * toggle that opens a drawer over a dimmed page, holding an optional
 * availability label, the same links and button, z4nta0's profiles, the
 * site's email, and its tagline. Each site passes what differs (the
 * wordmark's ending, the links, the button, the email, the tagline, and the
 * label) as props. The bar takes its scrolled style once the page moves, and
 * the drawer closes when the page changes, the scrim is tapped, Escape is
 * pressed, or the screen widens past the phone layout.

 * page has scrolled past 24px, switching the bar to its scrolled style, and
 * whether the drawer is open, which the toggle flips and any change of page
 * resets. While the drawer is open the rest of the page is inert, so keyboard
 * and screen reader users stay in the bar; tapping the scrim closes it,
 * Escape closes it and returns focus to the toggle, and a screen widened past
 * the phone layout closes it, since the toggle disappears there. The drawer
 * holds the availability label when the site gives one, the page links, the
 * call to action, the profile icons and email, and the tagline, each
 * arriving a step after the one above it. Both the bar's and the drawer's
 * links come from the site's page list, and React Router marks the one whose
 * route shows with aria-current. The call-to-action buttons are router links
 * to the page the site names.
